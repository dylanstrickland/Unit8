Other than the HTML tags, nothing need to be changed, as the element ID, which is referenced 
by the script, remains the same.

Assignment 6.3 (b)

Using the <button> tag used to create problems under Internet Explorer (which has since been discontinued)
The button tag allows you to add HTML elements inside the button (like images and other content).
It also has a forms attribute, and can be linked to other parts of the document body.

The main disadvantage to the <button> tag (other than it's not functioning in IE) is that 
if it's not given a type, the default will be assigned as "submit", and using the button will submit the form.
This can cause problems if there are many buttons on a page.
